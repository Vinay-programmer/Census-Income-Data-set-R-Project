# Census-Income-Data-set-R-Project
In this project, I processed the data and then developed the understanding of different features of data by performing exploratory analysis and Visualization. After getting sufficient knowledge performed the predictive task of classification to predict whether an individual makes over 50k a year or less, by using different machine learning Algorithms.
